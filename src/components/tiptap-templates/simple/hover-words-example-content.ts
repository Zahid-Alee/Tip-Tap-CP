<h1>Understanding Modern Web Development</h1>

<p>
  <span data-hover-word="true" data-word="JavaScript" data-title="JavaScript Programming Language" data-description="A high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It's one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web." data-metadata="Created by Brendan Eich in 1995" class="hover-word">JavaScript</span> 
  has revolutionized the way we build web applications. Combined with modern frameworks like 
  <span data-hover-word="true" data-word="React" data-title="React Library" data-description="A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It's maintained by Meta and a community of developers." data-metadata="First released: May 29, 2013" class="hover-word">React</span>, 
  developers can create sophisticated user experiences.
</p>

<h2>Core Concepts</h2>

<p>
  Understanding 
  <span data-hover-word="true" data-word="TypeScript" data-title="TypeScript Language" data-description="A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. It adds static type definitions to JavaScript." data-metadata="Developed and maintained by Microsoft" class="hover-word">TypeScript</span> 
  is essential for large-scale applications. It provides type safety and better developer experience through 
  <span data-hover-word="true" data-word="IDE" data-title="Integrated Development Environment" data-description="A software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development, including code editing, debugging, and building." data-metadata="Examples: VS Code, WebStorm, IntelliJ IDEA" class="hover-word">IDE</span> 
  support.
</p>

<h3>Advanced Topics</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span data-hover-word="true" data-word="API" data-title="Application Programming Interface" data-description="A set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. It specifies how software components should interact." data-metadata="Types: REST, GraphQL, SOAP, WebSocket" class="hover-word">API</span> 
    design and implementation
  </li>
  <li>
    <span data-hover-word="true" data-word="SSR" data-title="Server-Side Rendering" data-description="The process of rendering web pages on the server instead of in the browser. This improves initial page load time and SEO." data-metadata="Popular with Next.js, Nuxt.js, SvelteKit" class="hover-word">SSR</span> 
    vs 
    <span data-hover-word="true" data-word="CSR" data-title="Client-Side Rendering" data-description="The process of rendering web pages in the browser using JavaScript. The server sends a minimal HTML document and JavaScript handles the rendering." data-metadata="Common in SPAs (Single Page Applications)" class="hover-word">CSR</span>
  </li>
  <li>State management patterns</li>
  <li>Performance optimization</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mathematics in Programming</h2>

<p>
  Many algorithms rely on 
  <span data-hover-word="true" data-word="Math" data-title="Mathematics" data-description="The abstract science of number, quantity, and space, either as abstract concepts or as applied to other disciplines such as physics and engineering." data-metadata="Essential for: algorithms, cryptography, graphics, AI/ML" class="hover-word">Math</span> 
  concepts. Understanding 
  <span data-hover-word="true" data-word="Big O" data-title="Big O Notation" data-description="Mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Used to classify algorithms by efficiency." data-metadata="Common complexities: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(nÂ²)" class="hover-word">Big O</span> 
  notation helps evaluate algorithm efficiency.
